  I was thinking about making a documentaries object.  I feel like having the
scraper be in charge of scraping and also storing the list of documentaries and the individual
films works pretty well in this case although normally i would want to objects for the tasks.

I could use help on using 'pry'.  I tend to always work around it because i am not very good at it.

I set up the file structure myself.  I tried to do it with 'gem instal' but I don't really like how it works.
